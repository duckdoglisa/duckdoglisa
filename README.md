This repository contains data for the Living New Deal, a digital humanities project that seeks to enhance socio-spatial understanding of the New Dealâ€™s relationship to systemic racism and other socio-political issues, providing valuable new resources for scholars, teachers, and others interested in New Deal history.

This license allows reusers to copy and distribute the material in any medium or format in unadapted form only, for noncommercial purposes only, and only so long as attribution is given to the creator.  We ask that researchers and scholars utilizing our data notify us of their in-progress and finished work so that we may learn from their findings and share them with LND's national audience and the many volunteer researchers who have contributed to LND's database of New Deal sites.
